‚ú®Description
---------------------------------------------
 A face recognition attendance system makes use of facial recognition technology to identify and verify a person and mark attendance automatically.
Recent struggle with the pandemic has brought forth the issue with systems that require physical contact. A facial recognition attendance system is a contactless technology that provides freedom from any physical interaction between the man and the machine.
A facial recognition software captures and compares patterns on a person‚Äôs face and analyses the details to identify and verify the individual.

‚ú®Features of the project:
----------------------------------
‚Ä¢Login system for the administrator

‚Ä¢Employee registration portal

‚Ä¢Data set training 

‚Ä¢Face recognition done through the images that have been trained

‚Ä¢Marking employee attendance through face recognition system day-wise

‚Ä¢Contactless attendance tracking

‚Ä¢Easy to use

‚ú®I have used Python and MYSQL database. Libraries used include opencv, tkinter, PIL, etc.

‚Ä¢Upon selecting the employee details button you will be redirected to a page where you can save the new employee details,update the old employee details,delete the employee details,take photo button where the sample pictures of each employee are taken and stored into database once converted into grayscale

‚Ä¢Once the images have been captured ,which can be done by selecting  the Train your data button‚û°Ô∏èTrain Dataset. Here the images get converted inside the machine with the help of the algorithm used

‚Ä¢Once this process is done, you can start your face recognition process by selecting the button Face Recognition‚û°Ô∏èStart face recognition and it opens the camera on your device and recognises the person if his/her photo has been stored inside the database

‚Ä¢Once the Face has been recognised the employee's id,name,designation,time when the face has been recognised,date will get stored in a csv file... and this will be done day-wise. (For eg: The below image show the entry of the data into csv file)

‚Ä¢You can access the csv file and view it in the employee attendance portal, you can import and export the csv file where the csv has been stored!
